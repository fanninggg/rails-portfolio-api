# Welcome to my portfolio's API

Feel free to explore and see how it all works.

## Technologies

This was built using Ruby on Rails, Pundit, Devise & Simple Token Authenticationto provide up to date information about my latest projects and testimonials from some of my recent clients, colleagues and students.

This was built to serve a React app, which can be found here [https://www.benfanning.dev/](https://www.benfanning.dev/).
If you'd like to see the code of the React app, you can view that [here](https://github.com/fanninggg/portfolio)

## About

A lot of the work I have done over the years has been for clients whose code bases I am not at liberty to share, or on live commercial projects. As such, I thought this would be a nice way to show you some code that *I am* allowed to share. If you'd like to know more about this project or about me, feel free to get in contact with me: fanninggg@gmail.com
